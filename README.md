### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply the concepts learned throughout the course in setting up and maintaining a PostgreSQL database environment. You will perform various tasks related to database administration, including:

Database Creation: Creating a new PostgreSQL database instance.
Schema Design: Designing and implementing an appropriate database schema for a given scenario.
Data Import: Importing sample data into the database.
User Management: Managing database users, roles, and access privileges.
Performance Tuning: Implementing optimizations to improve database performance.
Backup and Recovery: Setting up backup strategies and practicing database recovery procedures.

### Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

Database Setup:

Set up a PostgreSQL database server on your local machine or a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure).
Initialize a new database instance.
Schema Design:

Design and implement the database schema based on a provided scenario or requirements.
Create necessary tables, indexes, and relationships.
Data Import:

Load sample data into the database to populate tables.
User and Access Management:

Create database users and roles with appropriate permissions.
Implement access control for various database objects.
Performance Optimization:

Identify and implement performance tuning strategies (e.g., indexing, query optimization).
Backup and Recovery:

Set up automated backups for the database.
Practice database recovery procedures (e.g., point-in-time recovery).
